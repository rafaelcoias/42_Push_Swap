# 42_Push_Swap

## Assignment

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions.

To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## Goal

Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

## What you need to know before starting push_swap

### C Structures

A struct in the C programming language (and many derivatives) is a composite data type (or record) declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory.

That allows the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name.

### Algorithms 

Obviously, you have to do a little search and learn about algorithms. That way you can choose what is the best, easiest or the one you liked the most.

You can create your own. But probably it already exists and you can get help from the web.

## Checker | Visualizer

I made my own checker and I thing it is very helpful to understand how the stacks work. It is an easy bonus.

If you don't want to do it yourself, you can use my <a href="https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/c-typedef-with-examples/">print_stacks.c</a> file to visualize your stacks. You have to remove <i>t_flags *f</i> for that to work.

I recommend <a href="https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/c-typedef-with-examples/">this</a> checker to see how good your algorithm is. It was my favourite.
