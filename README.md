# 42_Push_Swap

## Assignment

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions.

To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

## Goal

Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.

## What you need to know before starting push_swap

### C Structures

A struct in the C programming language (and many derivatives) is a composite data type (or record) declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory.

That allows the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name.
